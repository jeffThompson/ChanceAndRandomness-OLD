# READING THE I-CHING  

The *I Ching* (pronounced *yee jing*) or *Book of Changes* is an ancient Chinese form of divination. The book itself consists of 64 hexagrams (patterns of solid and broken lines) with commentary for each one, meant to be used as an oracle. To generate the hexagrams, a method of counting sticks from the yarrow plant is employed. This can also be done with three coins (like John Cage did) or dice, but the yarrow stick method is traditional and more fun. (Even earlier versions used cracks in a heated turtle shell as the input for interpretation.) You'll need 50 stalks total to read the *I Ching*.

Yarrow grows all over the North America, Asia, and Europe, often found along roadsides and the edges of fields. Go gather your own sticks! According to tradition, you really should use only *Achillea millefolium*, which has a *chi* more in-tune with the reader, and often gathered in a spiritually important place like the grounds of a temple.

## METHOD  
This is a somewhat simplified method meant more for generating random numbers than reading the *I Ching*. See [this post for a more detailed description](https://www.wikihow.com/Consult-the-I-Ching-Using-Yarrow-Stalk) that walks you through all the steps.  

**Setup:**  
1. Count your stalks and make sure you have fifty; while doing this, think about the question you want to ask  
2. Set one stalk aside, which will not be used in the reading  

**Divide and count:**  

3. Roughly divide the remaining stalks into two piles  
4. Take one from the right pile and hold in the left hand (between your pinky and ring finger)  
5. Take the left-hand heap in the left hand, using the right hand to pull off sticks in groups of four and put them in a pile, repeating until you have four or fewer remaining  
6. The remaining sticks should be placed between your ring and middle fingers  
7. Do the same process for the right-hand heap, with the remainder placed between your middle and index fingers  
8. This should leave a total of either 9 or 5 sticks  

**Two more times:**  

9. Gather the remaining sticks together  
10. Repeat the `Divide and count` process above two more times, giving you three piles  

**Read the piles:**  

|If...                         |Means                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------|
|All piles are small (5 stalks)|"solid becomes broken"|  
|All piles are big (9 stalks)  |"broken becomes solid"|  
|2 small (5x) and 1 big (9x)   |"broken"              |  
|2 big (9x) and 1 small (5x)   |"solid"               |  

This becomes the bottom line of the hexagram. You can then put all your stalks back together and repeat the entire process five more times to read a full hexagram.

## HOW TO USE THIS?  

Cage famously used the *I Ching* in his compositions as well as written texts, lectures, and drawings. Cage's use varied from reading the *I Ching* traditionally and using the prompts to spur ideas (kind of like *Oblique Strategies*) but later he used it more as a mathematical method. [This post by Steve Marshall](https://www.biroco.com/yijing/cage.htm) goes deep into Cage's process, as does [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25597623?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

You could follow Cage's methods, or create your own. Perhaps the four pile counts above could be mapped to numbers or up/down/left/right. You could use the counts directly as numerical values, either on their own or individually. Or consult the book (see [an online version here](https://archive.org/details/I-Ching/page/n1)) and use the text as a prompt or source.
