# CHANCE OPERATIONS

>"The conclusion that Dada drew from all this was that chance must be recognized as a new stimulus to artistic creation." — Hans Richter, *Dada: Art and Anti-Art*

>"I use chance operations instead of operating according to my likes and dislikes." — John Cage  

We'll start the course by exploring "chance operations," an idea that starts with artists and poets of the Dada movement but most famously embraced by composer and artist John Cage. Later, we'll talk about the distinction between *chance* and *random*, but for the next two weeks we'll avoid numbers, dice, etc in favor of improvisation and natural processes that intercede in otherwise deterministic studio practices.

Images and examples shown in class can be found in this week's `Images` folder.

## MORNING	
**Introductions, syllabus**  
Hello, what we're going to work on, using Github  

**What are "chance operations"?**  
"Chance operations" are methods used by visual artists, designers, composers, poets, etc to make decisions in their work, effectively removing their hand and mind from at least part of the process of making. By the early 20th-century, artists of all kinds were questioning the conventions of how art was made. One of the most radical moves these artists explored was the removal of the artist's hand, first through "automatic" processes meant to unplug conscious decision-making and later through embracing chance. John Cage expanded these ideas into his compositional and visual art practice in the 1950s, using improvisation, graphical scores, and tools like coin tosses and the *I Ching* (an ancient Chinese book used for divination)  

Compare, for example  Cage's seminal [*Music of Changes*](https://youtu.be/Yn3QZzw0vlY) (read more about this piece [here](http://www.lovely.com/albumnotes/notes2053.html)) with music like [Black MIDI](https://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/sep/23/impossible-music-black-midi/), which is highly-organized but chaotic-sounding electronic music.

Later artists would embrace this chaotic look and sound in more radical ways, like William S. Burroughs' [cut-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq_hztHJCM4) technique. We can think of "chance operations" as any means of making decision in your work that come from unpredictable sources: gravity, shuffling, wind, ant-paths, etc etc etc.  

**Dérive ("drift" in French)**  
Developed by Guy Debord in 1956, the dérive is "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiences." In other words, a random walk with no pre-defined destination as a way to experience a place, as well as about breaking out of the monotony of everday life under capitalism. See also: flâneur (to stroll, lounge, saunter, or loaf, via Old Norse meaning "to wander with no purpose")  

Debord's description, from *Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography*:    

    The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places — these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.

We'll head outside and do a dérive of our own to kick off our exploration of chance and randomness.

## AFTERNOON
**Gravity drawings**  
In 1933, Jean Arp made a piece titled [*According to the Laws of Chance*](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-according-to-the-laws-of-chance-t05005) . According to Arp: 

>"Since the arrangement of planes and their proportions and colours seemed to hinge solely on chance, I declared that these works were arranged 'according to the laws of chance,' as in the order of nature, chance being for me simply a part of an inexplicable reason, of an inaccessible order." (1974)

Our process:  
- Tear up pieces of black paper  
- Let them fall onto a white sheet of paper  
- Repeat until you reach an arrangement you like  
- Glue them in place (or apply glue to the pieces first)  

Alternatively, try:  
- Insert your own decision-making into the process in some way, "collaborating" with chance (ex: always dropping from the center, going outside and letting the wind take over, etc)  
- Tear up white paper and let fall on black  
- White on white, black on black  

**Gherasim Luca-style cut up photos**  
Based on a technique called *cubomania* created by Ghérasim Luca in 1944. Influenced by earlier Surrealist collage techniques but meant to break free of careful artistic choices, including a connection between the source material and the process applied to it: 

>"We have returned to the problem of knowledge through images... by establishing a clear distinction between images produced by artistic means and images resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures, such as the operation of chance or of automatism." (1945)  

Our process:  
- Pick a photo, either from the set provided or print your own  
- Cut the photo into squares of equal size (the number of squares is up to you)  
- Rearrange the squares, both position and rotation, in some random way—explore this option!
- Once you're satisfied with the configuration, glue the squares in place on a sheet of paper 

See also: Luca's poem ["Passionnément"](https://vimeo.com/74930350).  

**Further experimentation**  
- If there is any time left, for the rest of class experiment with one or more of the techniques we tried today. Feel free to modify or combine techniques, or invent your own!

## HOMEWORK
For next week, please think about ways you can collaborate with chance and order. Create an artwork of some kind (collage, drawing, photograph, website, performance, poem, etc etc) and bring to class next week. We'll do a short critique of the projects, discuss the reading (see below), then do some further exercises expanding on the idea of chance.

Please also bring some drawing supplies and tools that you might use next week.

## READING  
Please read the excerpts from John Cage's book *Silence*, found in this week's `Readings` folder. Write up a 1–2 paragraph response to something in the reading you found interesting, challenging, or disagree with in the text. Print and bring to class along with the readings (either printed or on your laptop).
