WEEK 1 (OCT 25)
Morning:	Introductions, syllabus

			"The conclusion that Dada drew from all this was that chance must be recognized as a new stimulus to artistic creation."
			— Hans Richter, "Data: Art and Anti-Art"

			Tristan Tzara, in "Dada Manifesto on Feeble & Bitter Love"
			(translated Barbara Wright)
			Take a newspaper.
		    Take some scissors.
		    Choose from this paper an article the length you want to
		    	make your poem.
		    Cut out the article.
		    Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up
		    	this article and put them all in a bag.
		    Shake gently.
		    Next take out each cutting one after the other.
		    Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the
				bag.
		    The poem will resemble you.
		    And there you are--an infinitely original author of
		    	charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by
		    	the vulgar herd.

		    Jackson Mac Low
		    "Stein 100: A Feather Likeness of the Justice Chair"
		    1999?
		    https://poets.org/poem/stein-100-feather-likeness-justice-chair

			Chance operations and aleatory music
			Derive
			Oblique strategies
			- make our own cards? share w each other?
			- http://www.openculture.com/2018/12/behold-original-deck-oblique-strategies-cards-handwritten-brian-eno.html

			"indeterminate" music
			- chance procedures to produce determinate, fixed score or recording
			- indeterminate notation, like graphical score (chance comes from how
			  performers take on the score)
			- combinations of the two

Afternoon:	Chance drawings
			about material, natural proc, etc to make random things
			not about systems or numbers yet (no dice, pls)

WEEK 2 (NOV 1)
Morning:	Random choices
			Dice, coin flips, bingo cage, etc
			Make our own dice

			The "Chaos Game" (desc on page 236) – perfect for random week
			- desc by Michael Barnsley
			- create two rules about moving and drawing a point
			- 50/50 chance of either
				- ex: move up by 12 and over by 2
				- move towards the center by 25%
			- choose a rule, make the move and draw a dot
			- repeat
			- simple way to make really complex random images

Afternoon:	Project exploring random choices
			Bring materials for next week to work with


WEEK 3 (NOV 8)
Morning:

Afternoon:


WEEK 4 (NOV 15)
Morning:	Psuedorandomness, intro to Processing

Afternoon:	Processing demos
			read shannon paper, other entropy stuff?

WEEK 5 (NOV 22)
Morning:	entropy
			first, randomness is chance (cage)
			- now randomness is shown actually to be a form of order
			- shannon, entropy, measure of information

			listen to white noise from diff gens?
			- and look at vis of them?
			- seeing diff where we can't hear, etc

			tauba auerbach's sorted bible
			- originally encoding way more info
			- now reduced to much less
			- like def of entropy in information

			How to Change Your Mind: What The New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us...
			Michael Pollan
			2018
			"In both physics and information theory, entropy is often associated with expansion—as in the expansion of a gas when it is heated or freed from the constraints of a container. As the gas’s molecules diffuse in space, it becomes harder to predict the location of any given one; the uncertainty of the system thus increases. In a throwaway line at the end of his entropy paper, Carhart-Harris reminds us that in the 1960s the psychedelic experience was usually described as 'consciousness-expansion'; knowingly or not, Timothy Leary and his colleagues had hit on exactly the right metaphor for the entropic brain."

			- counting and water vids not random, opposite actually
			- but playback site mentioned is and gives us random, non-random stuff
			
			- what appears random can, with context, be anything but
