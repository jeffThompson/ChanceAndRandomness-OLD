CHANCE AND RANDOMNESS (AND INFINITY?)
=======================================

"The project of life is to be in grace with chance."
— André Breton
(also: "Then I  made a  superb dive into the human conscience, that I  have infested with strange chances, formless flowers, and cries of marvels.", from Surrealism Manifesto)

first, randomness is chance (cage)
- later in the semester randomness is shown actually to be a form of order
	- shannon, entropy, measure of information

Oblique strategies

tauba auerbach's sorted bible
- originally encoding way more info
- now reduced to much less
- like def of entropy in information

The "Chaos Game" (desc on page 236) – perfect for random week
- desc by Michael Barnsley
- create two rules about moving and drawing a point
- 50/50 chance of either
	- ex: move up by 12 and over by 2
	- move towards the center by 25%
- choose a rule, make the move and draw a dot
- repeat
- simple way to make really complex random images

create our own rngs

- counting and water vids not random, opposite actually
- but playback site mentioned is and gives us random, non-random stuff

maria's book

listen to white noise from diff gens?
- and look at vis of them?
- seeing diff where we can't hear, etc

derive!

"Trashman also has a power called the "Random Alert Factor", based on the fictional "science of numantics." One of the principles of numantics, according to Trashman's Professor of Numantics Dr. Eugene Kranker, is that "from observing random phenomena, a general pattern may be deduced." Trashman is tuned into this mode of perception, giving him a synchronicity-based precognition/clairvoyance, of seemingly unrelated information by making observations of random (complex) phenomena. For example, on the inside back cover artwork of Subvert Comics #1, Trashman "hears" a crack in the sidewalk "speak" to him, warning him of an attack from behind. Strangely, Trashman's powers are diminished when he is exposed to an atmosphere lacking in a certain level of pollution.[5]"

"The randomness to me is always very precise, a kind of zeroing in. But there is a random element: the choice is never abolished." – Robert Smithson, https://www.robertsmithson.com/essays/fragments.htm

How to Change Your Mind: What The New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us...
Michael Pollan
2018
"In both physics and information theory, entropy is often associated with expansion—as in the expansion of a gas when it is heated or freed from the constraints of a container. As the gas’s molecules diffuse in space, it becomes harder to predict the location of any given one; the uncertainty of the system thus increases. In a throwaway line at the end of his entropy paper, Carhart-Harris reminds us that in the 1960s the psychedelic experience was usually described as 'consciousness-expansion'; knowingly or not, Timothy Leary and his colleagues had hit on exactly the right metaphor for the entropic brain."
