Set one aside
Roughly divide into two piles
One from right in left hand (b/w pinky/ring)
Count left by fours, remainder held
Count right by fours, remainder held

FIRST COUNT
9 left = 2
5 left = 3

Set aside sticks from previous
Gather and re-divide

SECOND COUNT + THIRD COUNT
(4 leftover is kept as 4)
8 = 2
4 = 3

READ THREE PILES
All small (4/5)		solid becomes broken
All big (8/9)		broken beomes solid
2 small, 1 big		broken
2 big, 1 small		solid
