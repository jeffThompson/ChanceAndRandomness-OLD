>"The conclusion that Dada drew from all this was that chance must be recognized as a new stimulus to artistic creation." — Hans Richter, *Data: Art and Anti-Art*

## AFTERNOON
**dérive ("drift" in french)**  
- developed by guy debord, 1956  
- "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiences"  
- about breaking out of the monotony of everday life under capitalism  
- see also: flâneur (to stroll, lounge, saunter, or loaf, via Old Norse meaning "to wander with no purpose")  
- debord's instructions, from "introduction to a critique of urban geography"  

    The sudden change of ambiance in a street within the space of a few meters; the evident division of a city into zones of distinct psychic atmospheres; the path of least resistance that is automatically followed in aimless strolls (and which has no relation to the physical contour of the terrain); the appealing or repelling character of certain places — these phenomena all seem to be neglected. In any case they are never envisaged as depending on causes that can be uncovered by careful analysis and turned to account.

**tristan tzara-style cut newspaper poems**  
- instructions for creating poems using the newspaper from tristan tzara, in "dada manifesto on feeble & bitter love" (1920, version below translated barbara wright)  
	
    Take a newspaper.
    Take some scissors.
    Choose from this paper an article the length you want to
        make your poem.
    Cut out the article.
    Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up
        this article and put them all in a bag.
    Shake gently.
    Next take out each cutting one after the other.
    Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the
        bag.
    The poem will resemble you.
    And there you are--an infinitely original author of
    charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by
        the vulgar herd.
