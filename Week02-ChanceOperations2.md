# CHANCE OPERATIONS 2

>"Process art is chance, contingency and indetermination" — Robert Morris

>"I set the rules but led chance exceed intent" — John Cage

This week, we'll continue last week's work considering "chance operations" as defined by Dada artists and composers like John Cage. We'll start with *Oblique Strategies*, a deck of cards created by composer Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt. Each card features a prompt meant to jolt one out of a creative funk. We'll first create poems from cut-up newspaper articles. Then we'll make some drawings using Eno's original cards, create our own deck collaboratively, and use those cards to create performance and drawing scores.

**NOTE! Next week we will meet in NYC! If you haven't already, please sign up for the bus ASAP to reserve your seat. You'll start your day at the Met, but I'll meet you in the lobby of MoMA at 1pm.**

Images and examples shown in class can be found in this week's `Images` folder.

## MORNING  
**Critique and reading discussion**  
We'll take a look at your projects together with a focus will be on how you made your piece and what the experience of using chance in your process was like.  

**Tristan Tzara-style cut newspaper poems**  
Instructions for creating poems using the newspaper from Tristan Tzara in *Dada Manifesto on Feeble & Bitter Love* (1920, version below translated by Barbara Wright):  
	
    Take a newspaper.
    Take some scissors.
    Choose from this paper an article the length you want to
        make your poem.
    Cut out the article.
    Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up
        this article and put them all in a bag.
    Shake gently.
    Next take out each cutting one after the other.
    Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the
        bag.
    The poem will resemble you.
    And there you are — an infinitely original author of
    charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by
        the vulgar herd.

Generate a poem using this method, gluing/taping the words to a piece of paper. We'll also listen to some of [Kenneth Goldsmith's *Fidget*](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Goldsmith-Fidget.html) and other chance-generated texts while you're working. Afterwards we'll do a reading of everyone's poems.

***Oblique Strategies* drawings**  
Created in 1974 by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, *Oblique Strategies* is a set of cards to help break out of creative block and to interject new directions into the artistic process. First edition, now impossibly rare, was a combination of cards created separately by Eno and Schmidt (see [the *original*-original hand-drawn version here](http://www.openculture.com/2018/12/behold-original-deck-oblique-strategies-cards-handwritten-brian-eno.html)). 

The cards are also in [an online version](http://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html), which is what we'll use today. Our process:  
	
    Start making a drawing, using any media and approach you want  
    Every five minutes we'll stop and take a picture of your drawing's progress
    ...then pick a new card from *Oblique Strategies* for everyone  
    You should respond to the card's prompt for the next five minutes in your drawing  
    We'll continue this process, periodically stopping to begin a new drawing  

**Ideation session for our own cards**  
With some experience using Eno and Schmidt's cards, we'll create our own set of prompts together. Take some time alone and write as many prompts as you can think of.

Consider:  
- Open-ended actions that change course or ask us to reconsider something  
- Can be directed at media, action, duration, mindset, etc  

We'll set out everyone's ideas, look them over, and take a lunch break to let it stew.

## AFTERNOON  
**Making our own card set**  
Following our ideation session (and a break), look through your ideas and gather 5–10 that you feel excited about. I'll type them up and print a set for everyone this week. This deck is both a takeaway from the class and a tool you can use through the remainder of the semester!  

**Drawing scores**  
While scores are traditionally rigorously-defined ways of presenting music to performers (staff paper, notes with agreed-on pitch and duration, etc), in the 20th-century many composers as well as visual artists began using the score as a way to describe an action that could be carried out in many different ways. 

John Cage defined three ways a score could be "indeterminate" (include chance):  
- Chance procedures to produce determinate, fixed score or recording (flipping a coin to decide if a note or silence should be written down)  
- Indeterminate notation (a graphical score, chance comes from how performers interpret the score)  
- A combination of the two (score with elements pre-defined using chance as well as open-ended options for performers)  

In class, we'll start by looking through John Cage's *Notations* book (1969) and *Notations 21* (2008), both in this week's `Readings` folder, as well as Fluxus scores. Pick a score that interests you and create a drawing that carries out the score in some way. How you interpret the score is up to you, but try to be both responsive and specific. What do the notations suggest in an improvisatory way? Optionally, you can also use *Oblique Strategies* and/or your own cards as an intervention in that process.

We'll spend the rest of the day trying out different scores and making drawings, followed by a short crit at the end of the day.

## HOMEWORK  
Over the next two weeks (since we'll be meeting in NYC next week), please create your own score and then carry it out in any medium. Feel free to work with others in realizing your score, either directing their work or collaborating to make the piece. The score will in of itself be a piece, so be specific about your notation. Both the score and the resulting artwork should show two weeks' effort, but feel free to be bold and experimental!
