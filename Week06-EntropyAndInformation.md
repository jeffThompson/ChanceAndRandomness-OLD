# ENTROPY AND INFORMATION

> "Only entropy comes easy." — Anton Checkhov  

In our last regular week together (before our final crit), we'll be talking about a surprising side of randomness: information. We're very used to thinking of randomness as gibberish or noise, unpredictable floods or a radio station that won't stay in tune. But while it may be counterintuitive, in 1948 Claude Shannon, then a researcher at Bell Labs, published a paper titled *A Mathematical Theory of Communication* (you can find a copy in last week's `Readings` folder) that suggested something exciting. Though very mathy, Shannon's paper showed that the information content of a message could be measured by showing how surprising the message was. Shannon used the term [*entropy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)), but we can also think about this as *randomness* — the more random the message, the more information it contains!

The way Shannon proposed measuring the amount of information in a message is different than the more advanced randomness measures we saw last week. He proposed that the more a message can be compressed, the more repetition it has in it, the less information it contains. In his 2018 book *How to Change Your Mind: What The New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us*, Michael Pollan further defines entropy:  

> "In both physics and information theory, entropy is often associated with expansion — as in the expansion of a gas when it is heated or freed from the constraints of a container. As the gas’s molecules diffuse in space, it becomes harder to predict the location of any given one; the uncertainty of the system thus increases. In a throwaway line at the end of his entropy paper, Carhart-Harris reminds us that in the 1960s the psychedelic experience was usually described as 'consciousness-expansion'; knowingly or not, Timothy Leary and his colleagues had hit on exactly the right metaphor for the entropic brain."

Today, we'll start by listening to two works that explore this idea. The first is Alvin Lucier's 1969 piece [*I Am Sitting in a Room*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room). In the performance, Lucier speaks into a microphone the following text, which is itself a description of the piece:  

> "I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice and I am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm, is destroyed. What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have."

The recording is then played back into the room, recorded, that recording played back, and so on for about 40 minutes. The result is a song-like drone created by the variations of the space the piece is performed in, the random variations of the space made tangible. It was accompanied by a visual performance from Mary Lucier, who photographed and re-photographed polaroids which were printed to slides. The images were "were timed to [Alvin Lucier's] audio tape and projected along with the sound in a twenty-three-minute presentation." Steve Reich's 1974–76 piece [*Music for 18 Musicians*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_18_Musicians) similarly creates a complex new form from a simple system. Performed by singers and several instruments, repeating but overlapping patterns of notes creates a constantly-shifting, always moving piece that is more than the sum of its parts. In both pieces, the idea is simple and contained but the results are chaotic, varied, and full of entropy.

## MORNING  
**Listening session and reading discussion**  
We'll start the day by listening to excerpts from Alvin Lucier's *I am Sitting in a Room*, Steve Reich's *Music for 18 Musicians*, and Holly Herndon's *PROTO*. All three of these pieces explore information in different ways: Lucier's seminal sound art piece creates a transformation of content (a single sentence) through random variations in the room; Reich's composition uses simple musical phrases that overlap to create very complex patterns; and Herdon's album uses an AI system trained on recordings of singers to create a new musical system from data and order. 

After listening to parts of each of these recordings, we'll discuss them in the context of the reading. How does the idea of `information = randomness` connect to what we've been doing this semester and what other paradigms does this idea of randomness and information suggest to you? Do you hear evidence of this idea in the recordings, or in contrast with the white noise we heard last week?


**Axidraw, work day, individual meetings**  
The rest of today will be for finishing your Processing sketches and, optionally, using the Axidraw to draw them on paper (non-plotter drawings can be printed on the inkjet). Think about ways you can use the `random()` function and simple shape commands to generate interesting, surprising compositions. I especially encourage you to create dozens (or hundreds, or thousands!) of variations and then cull through them for the ones you like best. **All sketches should be done and printed by 3.30pm for a short crit.**

I will also meet with everyone one-on-one to discuss your final projects in progress ahead of our final crit next week.

## AFTERNOON  
**More Axidraw and work time**  
We'll continue our work from this morning. Everyone's sketches should be ready for a short crit at 3.30pm.

## HOMEWORK  
Next week, we'll have a critique of your final projects. If you need some time to arrange furniture or set up equipment, that's fine, but extended installations need to be set up ahead of time. If you have any specific needs, please coordinate them with me or Gene Gort. I'm looking forward to seeing how your projects come out!
